\section{Objective}

As a student I am researching for internships that will prepare me to enter the work force. My goal is to "sharpen" my various skills and expand my current knowledge on writing an application. I am eager to learn something new and look for a position where I will be able to execute and succeed in an energizing environment. With a willingness to learn, this makes me an asset for teams or to work unaccompanied on given projects. Being able to give employers with full support, and use my technical-skills and marketing-skills to be able to get more work done efficiently will be my main focus when doing a job.
